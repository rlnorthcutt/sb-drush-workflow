 /**
 * @file
 * local.settings.php (Drupal 7.x)
 *
 * This settings file is intended to contain settings specific to this local
 * environment, by overriding options set in settings.php.
 *
 * Include this file from your regular settings.php by including this at the
 * bottom:
 *
 *   @include('local.settings.php');
 *
 * Placing this at the very end of settings.php will allow you override all
 * options that are set there. Prefixing it with the @ suppresses warnings if
 * the local.settings.php file is missing, so you can commit this to your repo.
